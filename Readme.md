\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

## Backend Progress Check:

1. Created auth routes for login and register now frontend can query the backend for routes

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

## Notes for Frontend progress

1. Please store the auth token in the cookies and not the local storage for safety reasons. Because cookies can't be accessed by js injection and are destroyed if the page is refreshed or browser is closed.
2. Special string have been created for your ease which state if there is an issue with the auth request, please use the Alert custom react hook to display these errors. USABILITY of this hook has been defined in the file itself in components
